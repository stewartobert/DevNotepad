#InternalSettings Directory

The internal settings directory contains an embedded set of files and folders which will 
be copied into the application settings directory if not already present. It is here to ensure that
default languages, syntax schemes, themes, plugins, etc. can be added or restored if they are
damaged, not yet added, etc.
